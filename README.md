=========================

Ok, I think it's time to deploy this thing.

This is going to be my blog, Infrafrequency. Now that I live far away from my friends, I need a way to contact them.
Also, a blog would be a good way to keep track of the things I'm doing in London.

Let's hope this thing works.
